# Classification of Beer Recipe Data into Segments

This project focused on exploring and analyzing beer recipes to uncover insights that can enhance the brewing process and beer quality. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis to classify beer recipes into segments, clusters, or classes, providing valuable insights for brewers and beer enthusiasts. It aims to provide valuable insights into beer recipes and brewing techniques, helping brewers improve their craft and beer enthusiasts discover new and exciting recipes.

## Project Objectives
1. **Classification of Beer Recipes:** Use machine learning to classify beer recipes into segments, clusters, or classes based on various features.
2. **Identifying Important Variables:** Determine the most important variables that contribute to the classification of beer recipes.
3. **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms in classifying beer recipes.
4. **Managerial Implications:** Provide managerial implications and recommendations based on the analysis for real-world applications in breweries.

## Data Source
The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/basaltier/homebrew-beer-data), originally scraped from brewersfriend.com. The dataset contains detailed information about beer recipes, including ingredients, brewing methods, and user ratings.
